The result of the code was that two threds were created and worked on the same variable. The second thread read the value of i before the first thread finished adding 1_000_000 which made things messed up. After the first thread finished the i was overwritten by thread 1. Thread two never saw this value of i which, so after subtracting 1_000_000 to the read value i was i << 0. Finally thread two overwrote i to be its calculated value such that i was not as expected.
